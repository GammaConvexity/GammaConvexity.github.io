								<p>Welcome to my professional portfolio website! The top row of websites that are linked from the <a href = index.html style = "color: blue;">homepage</a> were built by me (including this site) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
								<p>I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. At Cornell, I am a rising senior studying Policy Analysis and Management with Concentrations in Economics and Statistics. I am also double minoring in Computer Science and Data Science. </p>
								<p>On campus, I am currently a Research Assistant in the <a href = “https://www.dail.human.cornell.edu/” style = “color: blue;”>Design and Augmented Intelligence Lab<a>, where I have spent the past year developing and consistently updating an app called <i>Wayfind</i>. I co-founded and lead <a href = “https://cornellquantfund.org/” style = "color: blue;">Cornell Quant Fund</a>, Cornell’s first quantitative investing organization. I am also the president of Sigma Nu, Social and Service Fraternity where we are dedicated to supporting local Tompkins County non-profits in education, healthcare, and sustainability. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing poker, amateur bodybuilding, and listening to R&B music. My favorite food is Japanese beef curry paired with rice and milk. I’m very interested in Blockchain and Web3. </p>
								<p>Please feel free to contact me via email (arthursolwayne@gmail.com or asw263@cornell.edu). Please do check out the rest of the links on this site including my resume, GitHub, and other websites. Click on my head to navigate back home. </p>
