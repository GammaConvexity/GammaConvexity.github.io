								<p>Welcome to my professional portfolio website! The whole top row of websites that are linked from the <a href = index.html style = "color: blue;">homepage</a> were built by me (including this site) using JS, HTML5, and CSS3.</p>
								<p>I'm Arthur Wayne, a kid from New Jersey that is passionate about leveraging technology and data to solve problems in business. At Cornell, I am a junior studying in Policy Analysis and Management concentrating in Economics and Statistics with minors in Computer Science and Data Science. Given my academic background, I am best prepared for a career in trading, software engineering, or fintech. </p>
								<p>Outside of school, I founded two organizations that combine my interests in finance and coding. The first is Cornell Quant Fund, Cornell University’s first quantitative investing organization. We currently have 13 executive board members and 23 analysts across three arms: education, research, and investing. Along with our Blockchain Team Lead Advay, we are currently working on developing our very own cryptocurrency, the Big Red Coin! The second is Gamma Convexity, a multidisciplinary research journal for technology, finance, and policy. To me, Gamma Convexity is a central hub to culminate research I’ve done from all areas of my academic ventures. By utilizing the research that I conducted on index-option liquidity premia, I developed a statistical trading model to capture the premia which returned +238% / 6 months. I intend to continue my research and further develop the statistical model. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy eating food, exploring the outdoors, playing poker, and playing sports. My favorite food is Japanese beef curry paired with rice and milk. Additionally, I am a Research Assistant at the Design and Augmented Intelligence Lab, a behavioral neuroscience lab, the Cornell Anglers’ Society, Cornell’s fishing and conservation organization, and Cornell Poker Association. Sports I enjoy include basketball, volleyball, boxing, and weightlifting. Fun fact: I’ve played on multiple national teams for volleyball as a setter. </p>
